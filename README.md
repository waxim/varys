Varys
=====
Varys is a wordpress plugin to aid with comment moderation. It was suggested by Keith over at f1fanatic.co.uk and built by me.

## Features
Currently it just expands on the reasons for the rejection from the ``edit-comments.php`` list.

## TODO
- Allow for more advanced comment rejection/approval rules
